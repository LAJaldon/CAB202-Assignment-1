# Platforming-Treasure-Game
A game created using C where the player spawns at the top of the screen and has to traverse down to the bottom of the screen to grab a moving treasure. There are platforms marked with 'x' that destroys the player upon contact. The player has 10 lives and and spawns at a random place when respawning. Press T to stop the treasure from moving. If the player grabs the treasure, they gain 2 lives and respawns again. This project uses the CAB202 graphics library.
